    <h2>The story</h2>
    <blockquote cite="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts">
      <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <em> <q cite="" class="neighbors">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.”</q></em>
        The farmer said,
        <em><q cite="" class="farmer">“Maybe.”</q></em>
        The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <em><q cite="" class="neighbors">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q></em>
        The farmer again said, <em><q cite="" class="farmer">“Maybe.”</q></em>
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <em><q cite="" class="neighbors">“Oh dear, that’s too <q cite="" class="bad">bad</q> </q></em>,” and
        the farmer responded, <em><q cite="" class="farmer">“Maybe.”</q></em> The
        next day the conscription officers came
        around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,<em><q cite="" class="neighbors">Isn’t that great!</q>
        </em> Again, he said, <em><q class="farmer">“Maybe.”</q></em>
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <q cite="" class="good">good</q> or <q cite="" class="bad">bad</q> — because you never know
        what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you
        never know what will be the consequences of <q cite="" class="good">good</q> fortune.
